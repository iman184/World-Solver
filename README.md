## Description
This project implements the classic **Wordle game** in C, including a **heuristic-based automatic solver**.  
The game follows the original Wordle rules: a hidden 5-letter word, a maximum of six attempts, and colored feedback indicating correct, misplaced, or absent letters.  
Players can play manually, see solver suggestions, or watch the auto-solver play alone. A duel mode (player vs player or player vs solver) is also included.
